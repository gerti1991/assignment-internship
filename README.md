# Data Max Internship Assignment

Given two arrays (`array_a` and `array_b`) with integer numbers, write a function that returns an array containing all elements in both arrays without duplicates.

## Examples:

#### Example 1:
* array_a = [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7]
* array_b = [5, 6, 43, 8, 39, 74, 9, 100]
* Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7, 5, 6, 43, 39, 74]

#### Example 2:
* array_a = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
* array_b = [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50]
* Expected output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50]

#### Example 3:
* array_a = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
* array_b = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
* Expected output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## Requirements:
* Use only arrays as data structures. No set, trees or maps.
* Positioning of elements in the returned array is *not* important.
* There are no duplicated elements in either array.
* Aim for an optimal solution.
